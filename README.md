# The Fairy Rainbow Piano Garden

## A Magical 12-Week Piano Journey for Lucille

*Where music awakens magic and every note has a fairy friend*

---

## The Story Begins...

Long ago, before the first dawn painted the sky, the **Rainbow Serpent** traveled from the ancient Dreaming lands of Australia, carrying all the colors of creation in its shimmering scales. It swam across the vast oceans, guided by starlight and moonbeams, until it reached the misty green hills of Ireland.

There, in a circle of ancient oak trees, the Rainbow Serpent touched the earth, and where its rainbow light met the emerald grass, seven magical stones appeared - each one glowing with a different color of the rainbow. The **Sídhe** - the fairy folk who had watched from their hidden realm - knew these were no ordinary stones. They were the **First Keys**, and when touched with love, they sang.

The fairies built a magnificent **Rainbow Bridge** connecting their seven realms, and each stone became the voice of a fairy guardian. For thousands of years, only those with fairy blood could hear their true song...

**Until now.**

## Welcome, Lucille

Your Grandmother Aine has a secret she's been waiting to share. You see, our family carries the ancient blood of the Sídhe - the fairy folk of Ireland. And you, Lucille Aine Ní Mhurchú, have been chosen by the fairies to learn the sacred songs of the Rainbow Piano Garden.

Your kitten **Roxy-Rose** is no ordinary kitten. With her silver and grey coat that shimmers like moonlight, she is an ancient fairy spirit who has watched over our family for generations. She chose YOU, Lucille. And when you play the magical keys, she will help guide you on your journey.

Are you ready to meet your fairy friends and learn the songs that make flowers bloom and rainbows appear?

Let the magic begin...
