**Note Association:** All seven notes in harmony

### About Queen Áine

Queen Áine (pronounced "AWN-ya") is the ruler of the Fairy Rainbow Kingdom and an ancestor of Lucille's family. Her name is shared by Lucille's grandmother and by Lucille herself (as her middle name). She has been sleeping for a thousand years, waiting for someone pure of heart to restore the Rainbow Bridge through music.

### Appearance

Queen Áine has hair like silver moonlight (just like Roxy-Rose's fur - there is a connection). She wears a crown of seven stars, each one a different color of the rainbow. Her gown is woven from pure light, shifting through every color as she moves.

Her eyes, when open, are deep blue like Aria's lake - calm, wise, and kind.

### Her Realm: The Crystal Bower

The Queen sleeps in the Crystal Bower at the center of the Rainbow Bridge - a pavilion made of singing crystal that chimes gently with every breeze. When the full Rainbow Bridge shines with all seven colors, the bower fills with light and the Queen awakens.

## Grumble - The Lonely Shadow

**Role:** A character who becomes a friend
**Appears:** Weeks 5-6, during challenges

### About Grumble

Not all creatures in the fairy realm are bright and cheerful. Grumble is a small shadow-sprite who lives in the spaces between the keys. He's not mean - just lonely and a bit grumpy because no one ever noticed him.

### Appearance

Grumble looks like a small, fuzzy shadow with two glowing yellow eyes. He's about the size of a mouse and likes to hide in dark corners. When he's happy (rare, but possible), he turns slightly purple around the edges.

### His Story

Grumble used to be scared of music - it was too bright, too loud, too happy. But as Lucille practices, she plays some soft, gentle notes that don't hurt his ears. Slowly, he starts to come out of hiding. By the end of the curriculum, he's a friend who likes to listen to quiet music.

### Musical Tip

When you play very softly, you might be making a friend like Grumble. Not all creatures like loud music - sometimes the quietest notes are the most important.
